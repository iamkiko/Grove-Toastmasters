## The Official Website for the Grove Toastmasters Group

Grove is a dinner club that meets on the first Wednesday of every month, at 18:30 at Kelvin Grove.

Founded in 1994, we have focused on being an all-inclusive family of public speakers from all backgrounds and experience levels.

[Meet the team](https://grovetoastmasters.com/about)

We are open to all interested in improving their confidence and communication, seeking to build leadership skills or simply are curious!

We welcome all guests and speakers, regardless of experience levels to join us for dinner with a variety of speeches from diverse backgrounds and varying topics. There is no obligation to join or speak; we are aware of how daunting the first steps can be!

We are a member of Toastmasters International, a non-profit educational organization that teaches public speaking and leadership skills through a worldwide network of clubs.
